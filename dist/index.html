Winston Churchill sends Inspector Campbell (Sam Neill) to retrieve them, and whilst Tommy's Aunt Polly urges him to hand them over, Tommy wants to keep them for leverage. Campbell places Grace (Annabelle Wallis) in Birmingham as an undercover barmaid to help him locate the guns, and she takes up work in the Garrison - a local pub that the Shelbys frequent, and later purchase. Tommy strikes up a deal with Campbell regarding the guns, and he instructs Grace to get close to Tommy for information on them. His sister Ada (Sophie Rundle) falls pregnant with her communist boyfriend Freddie Thorne (Iddo Goldberg), who is a former close friend and war comrade of Tommy. Billy Kimber (Charlie Creed-Miles) confronts Tommy over him fixing his horse races.</p></div></div><div class="season"><h3>Season 02</h3><div class="desc"><p>After the cliffhanger at the end of season one, we discover that Grace shot Major Campbell (Sam Neill) on the train station platform and left him to die. Two years later, Tommy gets caught up with the IRA and Campbell returns to Birmingham, having survived but obtained a leg injury. Polly sees a medium for information about her children, who were taken from her when they were very young. Sabini's (Noah Taylor) thugs beat Tommy up, and Campbell visits him in hospital to threaten him with information he knows about the IRA involvement. He then takes a barge to Camden to meet with Alfie Solomons and strike up a deal.</p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818pPYa3dwL._RI_.jpg" alt=""></div></div><div class="season"><h3>Season 03</h3><div class="desc"><img src="https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/peaky-blinders-ep4.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=646&h=431&crop=1" alt=""><p>Peaky Blinders series three opened with a lavish wedding. After the hushed-up suicide of Grace’s husband, she returned from New York with her and Tommy’s baby son (conceived during series two’s extra-marital fling) to make an honest man of Thomas Shelby – literally so. On their wedding day, Grace made Tommy promise to put an end to the criminal business and keep his new family safe. “No guns in the house,” he vowed. Cut to Arthur, that same episode, in that same house, shooting dead a Soviet spy in the wine cellar, then burning the body in the extensive grounds of Tommy’s stately home. (This was the same Arthur, incidentally, who was strictly on the wagon following his marriage to pious Quaker Linda—sarcastically dubbed by John “the Madonna of Moseley”—but who had a few whiskies at the wedding “to remind him why he doesn’t drink”.)</p></div></div><div class="season"><h3>Season 04</h3><div class="desc"><p>The boxing match in Peaky Blinders’ series four finale told its story in miniature: a skinny gypsy boy vs. a towering hulk named Goliath. The underdog took round after round of pasting, but just when it looked as though he was beaten, he took charge, took the win and the big guy didn’t know what hit him. So it was in the Shelby family fight against New York-Sicilian mafioso Luca Changretta. He came for everything the Birmingham outfit had, and it seemed as though it was going to be a walkover. Against the odds, Tommy’s shrewd moves and a bullet from Arthur won it for the Peaky Blinders.</p><img src="https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2017/11/Adrien-Brody-Peaky-MAIN-e29efd8.jpg?quality=90&resize=620%2C413" alt=""></div></div><div class="season"><h3>Season 05</h3><div class="desc"><img src="https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/peaky-blinders-e1543875863344.jpg" alt=""><p>Season 5 sees the world thrown into turmoil by the financial crash of 1929. Opportunity and misfortune are everywhere. When Tommy, who’s now an MP, is approached by a charismatic politician with a bold vision for Britain, he realises that his response will affect not just his family’s future but that of the entire nation.</p></div></div></div><div class="container-2" id="cast"><h2>CAST</h2><canvas></canvas></div><div class="container-3" id="reviews"><h2>REVIEWS</h2><div class="grid-container"><div class="grid grid-1"><h2>Season-01</h2><p><span>"</span>Undeniably entertaining, though more as a soap romp than a drama; I didn't feel quite as involved with the gun heist from the Birmingham Small Arms factory and the warring gangs as I think I was meant to be. <span>"</span></p><h3>- Gaurdian</h3></div><div class="grid grid-2"><h2>Season-02</h2><p><span>"</span>It was beautiful, a vengeance killing that touched on myth to find its impact.
